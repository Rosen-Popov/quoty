### Quoty 
A very simple and rudamentary shell script\
Displays a line form a file randomly.\
Just thought it looked cool.\
Currently has just quotes from The Stromlight Archive.\
To display a line each time you open a shell (If you put it in your .bashrc )\
symlink with mine with: $ ln -s ~/.config/quoty/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
